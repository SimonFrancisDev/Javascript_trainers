        <p>we'll use javascript to convert tempreatures from celsius(0C) <br>
            to Farenheit(0F). The formula is : <br>
            .Farenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32 <br>
            . Celsius = (Farenheit - 32) * 5/9 <br>
            2h. The temperature is 25degC. Calculate the temperature in Farenheit.(77) <br>
            2i. The temperature is 85degF. Calculate the temperature in Celsius.(30) <br>
            2j. The temperature is -5degC. Calculate the temperature in Farenheit.(23) <br>
